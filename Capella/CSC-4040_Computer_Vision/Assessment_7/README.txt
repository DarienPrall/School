Face Detection and Blurring App

Description
This Python application detects human faces in images using OpenCV's DNN module, classifies images into "face" or "no face", and applies a Gaussian blur to anonymize detected faces. Itâ€™s designed for privacy-focused applications such as photo redaction or entry control systems.
